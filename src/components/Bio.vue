  <h1>bio</h1>
    <p class="blurb">My name is Ingo Duarte and I’m the founder of Lemniscarte. I’m a drummer, carnaval band founder, surfer, dog lover, synth geek, composer and sound designer.</p>
    <p class="blurb">I’ve been doing all this for some 20 years.<br>Except dogs, I’ve loved them since I was a baby.</p>
    <p class="blurb">I am passionate about sound and its narrative strength. That's why I approach projects as a collaborator: by giving educated input as well as being flexible and communicative I can find new ways to give my clients exactly what they want.</p>
    <p class="blurb">Moving from Brazil to California, by way of France, I can say that I’m lucky to have been exposed to different music, instruments, and its incredible musicians - from many places in the world.</p>
